# My-PC


A Pure CSS and HTML picture of my pc that's interactive with JS.
<p>Check out my <a href="https://codepen.io/sydney-jeffries/pen/ZVyxdV"> CodePen </a> and interact with the power button. </p>

 As of now, I havn't gotten around to coding it to turn off. This was one of my early projects. From September to Janurary I only coded on codepen. I made some really neat creations. Go ahead and browse my CodePen profile to see some of my silly/nerdy creations!
